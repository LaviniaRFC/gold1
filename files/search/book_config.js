Everywhere she went: the dinner table, the bathroom, the car... I sat her down and tried to reason with her, and she was really annoyed by that, like I was some cavemen who didn’t understand anything. It was infuriating! And the worst part is that while I was trying to reason with her, she was still looking\nat her damn phone and making faces, as if I\nwasn’t even there. I got\nso outraged that I just grabbed her phone and threw it out the window. It was completely ruined, and then I told her she couldn’t have a new one until she learned some\nself-control. What happened next was really scary. The moment after\nI smashed her phone she just stood there, shocked, and then she just lost it and started screaming hysterically. One of the neighbors even called\nthe police. She was still screaming when they arrived. It was really embarrassing. That was over a week ago, and we haven’t said a word to each other since.\nI was a cool dad for many years, but I’m afraid those days are over. Last week my son showed me this amazing new camera app that you use to make short videos and take funny pictures. I didn’t\ngive it much thought at first, but when I saw what he could do with it, I was quite astonished. So I decided to install the app on my phone and asked him to show me how to use it. That’s when I realized\nI was outdated. I couldn’t learn how to use the app!\nI was trying very hard,\nbut just couldn’t wrap my mind around it. I was so perplexed that, after a while, my son just gave\nup and said “I think it’s better if you just use the regular camera app.” It was shocking.\nI got very annoyed at my students whenever they tried to use their phones during class. I mean, it was so irritating. Not\nto mention disrespectful. Then the other day we had a meeting and the head teacher explained we were going to implement a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy in the school. It means we’re now supposed to encourage students\nto use their phones as a learning tool. At first, I\nwas really puzzled and didn’t really know what\nto do. However, the other teachers were having astonishing results so I decided to give it a try. It was very surprising to see that students were actually becoming more engaged and were participating\na lot more. Last Friday I\nwas amazed to see all\nmy students – really, all\nof them – had done their homework. The reason was that they had to use their phones to do it.\n64\n","","TRYING OUT GREAT STORIES\nChoose one of the stories below and discuss it with your partner.

In my house alone we have two aunts, three uncles, my grandparents and, of course, my mother, father, brothers and sisters. We are very happy living together, even if sometimes our values are different from generation to generation.\n2\nIn my country children usually leave home when they go to college. Leaving our parents’ house makes us far more independent and autonomous. Many of us get jobs and never go back to our original homes. I think that’s one of the reasons we have so many highways: we travel a lot...\n3\nIn some places in my country, elder parents normally live with their daughters, even if\nthey have many sons. This tradition is not\nso common in bigger cities as it is in small towns, but even nowadays some girls don’t get married because they will have to take care of their parents in the future.\n4\nIn the country I come from there isn’t so much pressure on young people to go to college immediately after they finish high school. Many leave their parents’ home, get jobs, and only then start higher education. I believe it is much better this way, as it allows us to make more mature career choices.\n5\nIn my country the elderly are seen as wise and children learn from a very early age that their older relatives, even the ones who have already died, must be respected and honored. Oh, and meals are special moments shared by parents and their children. I’m pretty sure this helps our families be far more harmonious than in many other places.\nHost:\nMitchell: Host: Mitchell:\nHost: Mitchell:\nHost: Mitchell:\nHost: Mitchell:\nHost: Mitchell:\nHost:\nWelcome back. In today’s program, we’re discussing the concept of family. Families are the base of our society, and they come in different shapes and sizes. We have a guest here to tell us all about his unique family. Welcome, Mitchel.\nGlad to be here, Debbie.\nSo, tell us, Mitchel. What’s your family like?\nSome people don’t even refer to us as a family, but we absolutely insist on being called that. We are a different family, but a family even so. There’s me, my twin sisters, my aunt May, and our two dogs. Our parents died in a car crash shortly after the twins were born so we came to live with our aunt. I was only 15 then.\nAs the older brother, what was it like for you to help raise your sisters?\nIt was so hard, but my aunt was great handling the whole situation. She taught me how to be an adult and trusted me with the girls since she had to work to provide for us. She is our rock; the most caring person in the world. We have a very deep bond of love and mutual respect.\nThat was some time ago, right? What are things like nowadays?\nWell, now I’m able to help her more financially. I’m working part-time now while I finish college. I’m studying to be a nurse. We also live in a bigger house now which is great for the girls. They have lots of space to play and I finally get to have my own room.\nMitchel, I guess lots of people find yours an unusual family, right?\nThat’s true. Some people don’t even think of us as a family, since there’s no mother or father, but what really matters is the way we feel. And we all feel like we are part of a family.\nAnd tell me, Mitchel. What are your values?\nI mean, what is really important to your family?\nThe one thing we care about the most is being with each other and spending quality time together. For instance, we have dinner together every day. No TV, no tablets, no phones, we just sit around the table and talk about our day.\nThat’s very nice. What else is important to you?\n123\nAUDIO SCRIPT\n","Mitchell:\nHost: Mitchell:\nHost:\nMitchell:\nHost:\nSpeaker 4\nWe value honesty above everything else. I am very transparent in everything I do, and I guess the girls learned to be like that from me. The other thing is trust. We trust each other no matter what.\nAnd how old are the girls now?\nThe girls are seven years old, and they are still a handful. For instance, they are starting to ask those complicated questions.\nThis is such a great example for so many people out there. Young people can accomplish a lot when we encourage and trust them. Do you think your family is an example to other families?\nI don’t know, Debbie. It’s hard to compare us with more traditional families. We just do the best we can with what we’ve got. The important thing is that we have a powerful sense of family and a strong connection.\nThat’s a great story, Mitchel. Thank you for sharing it with us.\nEXPLORING 2\nWoman:\nI don’t really think it’s fair to pin all this on the boy’s mother. She was in a relationship with him for several years and when they broke up, he never even called to see how she was doing. I guess there’s plenty of blame to go around.\nLANGUAGE WORKOUT 1\nNumber 1\nWoman:\nNumber 2\nTeen Boy:\nSpeaker 1\nMan: I believe Ben is telling the truth. I know him, and I’m telling you, he’d never do anything like reject or hide his own son. If you ask me, I think the boy’s mother is in the wrong. It was selfish not to tell him. He would probably have asked her to marry him instead of breaking up with her.\nSpeaker 2\nThese are my parents. As you can see, my father is a lot older than my mom. She’s so pretty that sometimes people ask my dad if she’s his daughter. He hates that. These are my sisters. Betty is the oldest of the three and Suzie is my baby-sister. She’s only seventeen. Actually, my uncle took this picture the day before Suzie travelled to Italy on an exchange program. She’s been there for the past 5 months.\nWoman:\nI suppose things like these do happen. The boy’s mother wanted to bring him up all by herself so she moved away. Anyway, there’s no point in going around blaming people. The important thing is to move on. I hope they can get over all this and have a normal father-son relationship.\nSpeaker 3\nMan: Everyone says Ben didn’t know about the boy, but I doubt it. I find it hard to believe the boy’s mother never tried to get in touch and tell him he was going to be a father. I’m pretty sure she tried to reach him somehow.\nNumber 3\nTeen Boy:\nMy mother got really angry with me yesterday. We were having a barbecue in the backyard and I was supposed to care for my little brother while she fed my baby sister. We always have to help mom because a baby and a two-year-old together are a little too much for anyone on their own to look after. Anyway, little Timmy was playing with his toys on the grass and I got distracted playing my guitar. Before I knew it, little Timmy tried to climb up the table. He pulled the tablecloth and all the food came down on him. He wasn’t hurt, but lunch was officially ruined.\nIt took us quite a long time to climb up\nthe mountain and it was quite dangerous because it got dark and we couldn’t camp for the night. I guess we were pretty lucky because the sky was clear and the moon was out, giving us a little bit of light.\n124\n","UNIT 2\nEATING HEALTHY OR EATING CRAZY?\nThere’s no way you’re gonna convince them to join you.\nNonsense.

I’m somewhat skeptical. I found it too much like a religious\ncult.\nWoman: I understand how it may look that way. I had the same feeling at first. But looking at it from\na different perspective, I think it’s fascinating how these people are discovering entirely new ways of living.\nMan: I see your point, but I don’t entirely agree. Many of them seem to be under the illusion\nthey have found the Holy Grail, when in fact they end up becoming obsessed with their bodies and the food they consume.\nWoman: You’ve got a good point there and I agree that some people really take it to extremes.\nHowever, it’s important to point out that they are indeed healthier than most people. These people may have reached a higher level of consciousness when it comes to food.\nMan: I respectfully disagree. We cannot overlook the fact that, even with all the information\navailable today, many people still prefer\nto eat convenience foods because they are always short of time and this is not likely to change. I think we should focus on making normal food healthier.\nWoman: So, I guess we’ve reached a stalemate. Anyway, my class is about to start.

What matters is what is more important or necessary to you.\nCan you elaborate on that, Professor?\nOK, let’s say two people moved to the city to find better jobs and more leisure activities. They get used to the hectic pace of life and they love the cultural variety and endless possibilities. Time goes by. They reach a more stable financial situation, get married, have kids, and realize they want to slow down and find a quieter, safer place to raise the kids. As a result, they move back to the countryside.\nI see your point now. As a matter of fact, I guess that’s why my parents moved back to the country when I was born.\nAnd since you wanted a more exciting life, you moved back to the city, right?\nYes, I suppose so. I left for college and never really looked back, but now I’m wondering if I’ll return one day.\nIt’s not a rule or anything. Our priorities are constantly changing and we often make adjustments in our lives because of that. I, for instance, raised my kids here in the city and it was fine, but my oldest son has been thinking of moving to the country.\nGirl:\nI remember the first meal we had together.\nIt was a complete disaster. I simply did not know what to do, and they didn’t think it was necessary to explain how they ate because\nit was so trivial to them. I spent the first ten minutes looking for a fork, a spoon, anything. Then they started just grabbing food from\nthe plates, so I did the same, and suddenly everyone stopped and looked at me. It was so embarrassing. I mean... How was I supposed to know I was using the wrong hand?\nTell me about it. I had to learn how to eat all over again. My host family was really nice in that way. They knew I wasn’t familiar with their customs and they took the time to teach me.\nI was actually amazed at the ritualistic way in which they conducted every step of the meal. It was about a lot more than just eating. The only part that really killed me was using chopsticks.\nLIVIN’ IN THE CITY\nBoy:\nUNIT 3\nStudent: Professor:\nStudent: Professor:\nStudent:\nProfessor: Student:\nProfessor:\nStudent:\nProfessor:\nStudent: Professor:\nStudent:\nProfessor:\nProfessor, nowadays lots of people move out of big metropolitan areas due to the stress of what they call “big city life”. Do you think that’s the best solution?\nNot necessarily, small towns have problems of their own. There are considerably less employment opportunities, and not much room to grow. That’s why thousands of people leave small towns and arrive in big cities every day searching for a better life.\nSo, where is the best quality of life then?\nI believe our quality of life is not determined by whether we live in a big city or small town, but rather by whether the place we live in suits us or not. Enjoying where you live is a key factor for your well-being. That explains why some people will find better quality of life in a big city, for instance.\nThere are certainly more opportunities in a big city, but can we call it quality of life when you are breathing in polluted air, spending hours stuck in traffic, and putting yourself in danger every day?\nThat’s a good point, but don’t forget that small town problems can have a pretty bad effect on you as well. There’s usually less of\nBITS OF CULTURE\nBoy: I was at this nice family home in Dublin. The lady of the house was showing me to my\nroom and she said, “Go up the apples and turn left.” I looked at her and she repetead, “Off you go, laddie, Up the apples”. I didn’t know what to do, so I just looked at her, paralyzed. Then she pointed to the stairs and said real slow, “Go up the apples, then turn left”. That’s when it hit me. The “apples” were the stairs.\nEXPLORING\n126\n","Girl:\nIt was my second month in a family home in Barcelona, and the couple’s teenage son had been hitting on me since I’d arrived there. I was feeling very uncomfortable, so I went to the parents to have a word with them. I explained the situation and said that I really liked the\nboy, but that he was confusing things and\nwas embarassing me. Next thing I know the father starts screaming and the mother starts crying. I didn’t know back then, but the Spanish word “embarazada” means pregnant! So they understood that their seventeen-year-old son had gotten me pregnant. That was a fine mess I got myself into. It took me over an hour to explain to them what was actually happening.\nGRAMMAR TALK\nSpeaker 7\nMan: This was a disappointment to me. I don’t have quite as many options as I was led to believe. The pay is a bit better, but since the cost of living is higher, in the end my financial situation is almost the same.\nSpeaker 8\nWoman:\nUNIT 4\nI think it’s slightly more complicated now.\nIn the big city, we seem to have a lot more relationships, but people are not as close as to what I’m used to. Relationships here are far more superficial.\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER\nSpeaker\nWoman:\nSpeaker\nMan:\nSpeaker\nWoman:\nSpeaker\nMan:\nSpeaker\nMan:\nSpeaker\nWoman:\n1\nIt’s not quite the same here. I was used to big rooms and large backyards. Now I have to live in an apartment that is not much bigger than my dad’s kitchen.\n2\nThis is significantly better. What an improvement! Where I used to live we only had one of everything: one movie theater, one nightclub, one mall. It’s no wonder everyone knew where everyone had been the night before.\n3\nI think I was lucky in this respect. I live near\na big park, so it’s almost as good as it was back home. It’s not exactly the same as having squirrels living in your back garden, but my daily walks in the park made the transition a lot easier.\n4\nI honestly don’t know if it’s much better or much worse. There are a lot of ways to get around, but everything is always so crowded. At least now I know can get by without a car.\n5\nI know this problem is normally a lot worse in the city, but to be honest, in my case I guess it’s pretty much the same. There was a big factory in the town where I lived, so I was no stranger to breathing in smoke.\n6\nThis has been terrible. I’m not nearly as far from work as I used to be, but it takes me twice as long to get there. I knew this was going to be an issue, but it’s way more difficult to cope with than I had expected.\nLANGUAGE WORKOUT 1\nConversation 1\nTeen Girl:\nTeen Boy: Teen Girl:\nTeen Boy: Teen Girl:\nAre you still planning to move out of town after we graduate?\nSure thing. I can’t wait to get out of this town.\nYou must be out of your mind. You’re exchanging this quiet, wonderful place for traffic, stress and pollution.\nThat may be true, but big cities have a lot more opportunities. We both know I won’t find a good job here.\nI don’t think I would want any of these “wonderful” opportunities. Will you get a better salary? Sure, yes, but the cost of living is way higher.\nConversation 2\nWoman: That’s it. I’ve just finished unpacking the last box. We are officially moved in.\nMan: It’s going to be nice living in the city, but if I’m honest I already miss our old house.\nWoman: It was a bit nicer, wasn’t it?\nMan: A bit? The old house was much better than\nthis one.\nWoman: Oh, come on. It’s not that bad. Plus, we agreed not to spend all our money until we\nwere sure we wanted to stay here.

Thanks for the advice about that situation with Mum and Dad. I’ve decided not to tell them I’m moving out for now. I’ll wait until after the holidays. Anyway, the reason I’m calling is just to let you know we’ll be getting together for Grandma’s birthday on June, the sixth. That’ll be a Friday.

I imagine it’s been tough because of the divorce, right?\nA little, but I guess it’s better this way. My mom was miserable all the time when they were married, so it is probably for the best.\nI see. What about Angela?\nIt’s a lot harder for her. She’s only three years old, so she doesn’t really understand what’s going on, and because of the court decision, she only gets to see our dad once every two weeks. She asks about him all the time.\nPoor thing. She’ll need some time to get used to the situation.\nUNIT 5\nEXPLORING 1\nConversation 1\nConversation 5\nMan: I think fast-food companies should be made responsible for the current state of public\nhealth. Woman: Why is that?\nMan: Well, they have convinced three entire generations that eating junk is acceptable. People have no idea how much salt, sugar, and fat they are consuming.\nWoman: I see your point, but let’s not forget that you can always choose to eat somewhere else. I mean, you are not going to die of heart disease because of fast food, are you?\nMan: Not me, but I’ve had access to information.\nWoman: Doesn’t everyone these days?\nMan: No, I don’t think it’s that simple.

What don’t you get?\nThis! What’s the deal with all these people? You know, guys like this Youtuber. They come out of nowhere and get seriously famous. I mean, anyone could do that.\nWell, it’s fun!\nLook at that! Almost three million people have watched this stupid video.\nYeah, this guy is a major Internet celebrity.

Look. She’s going to say the funniest thing now.\nHave you memorized the dialogue?\nJust the most memorable parts.\nGosh, Mom.\nHey! Give it a rest. I don’t judge the stuff you watch online all day long.\nI just can’t wrap my mind around this. There are so many other shows out there that are just as good. Why on earth would anyone watch the same show over and over again?\nWell, as you said, you just don’t get it. So I won’t even try to explain.\nIt was a boiling hot day and I’d had a few too many beers. So there I was – shirt off – showing off my not exactly athletic body –\nplaying songs on my guitar. I was about to\ngive everyone a break when someone asked me to play Mr. Jones, by the Counting Crows, and it was then that things went downhill. It’s a really catchy tune so I started dancing as well. A cousin of mine filmed the whole thing without telling me. Later on, he uploaded the video on YouTube, and that was when things snowballed. Before I knew it, everyone had seen the video. All my family and friends, all the people at work, even my ex-wife and my two kids. The worst part was, it was hilarious! Even I couldn’t stop laughing every time I saw it. Soon after, somebody rang to ask me permission to show the video on TV. I was far too embarrassed and said no. But I often imagine what might have happened if I had said yes.\nStory 2\nWoman:\nConversation 3\nIt all began a couple of months ago. I was playing with my son and our dog in the backyard. At first, we were having a blast, but then our dog decided it would be even funnier to chew on my son’s flip-flops. Boy, he was so angry. He got up and started to tell off the dog just like I do, and the dog pretended to listen to him, but wouldn’t return the flip-flop. Quietly,\nI took my phone, stepped back and filmed\nthe whole thing. We all had a lot of fun with\nthe video, and later that day I uploaded it on YouTube for some friends to see it and then just sort of forgot about it. Sometime later a friend of mine called. The video had gone viral! It had over a million views. I was even able to make some money with advertisements.\nTO BUY OR NOT TO BUY?\nWoman: Teen Boy: Woman:\nTeen Boy: Woman: Teen Boy:\nWoman: Teen Boy: Woman:\nTeen Boy: Woman:\nWhat are you playing?\nI’m not playing. I’m watching a video.\nBut isn’t this that game you like? Royal Clash or something?\nNo. It’s a video of someone else playing it. Hmm. Sorry. I just don’t get it.\nThere are lots of video channels like this. It’s about the game. It shows different moves, strategies, and stuff like that.\nGeez! This has millions of views. It’s a very popular channel.\nI’m confused. Can you explain to me why somebody would prefer to see someone else play their favorite game instead of playing it themselves?\nI play it too, sometimes, but I like watching these videos as well.\nHmm, well, maybe I am getting old.\nUNIT 6\nEXPLORING\nConversation 1\nEXPLORING 2\nWoman: Man:\nWoman:\nI’ve got nothing to wear to my cousin’s wedding.\nNonsense! You’ve got loads of dresses sitting in your wardrobe and more shoes most people will own in a lifetime.\nOh, you just don’t get it, do you? It’s all about the ritual. You go out, try things on, go from shop to shop, until you find that perfect- looking outfit.\nStory 1\nMan:\nIt all started when I had the unfortunate idea of picking up my guitar and playing a few tunes at a barbecue we were having with my family.\n129\nAUDIO SCRIPT\n","Man: I really don’t. You’ve got some really nice dresses and some of them are virtually brand\nnew! Why don’t you wear one of those? Woman: I don’t know.\nMan: Think about it like this: how much will you probably end up spending on an outfit for\nthe wedding?\nWoman: Hmm... let’s see: dress, shoes, purse, some other accessories... it will probably come\naround to 400 pounds if I stay away from the more expensive department stores.\nMan: OK, and what else could you do with this money?\nWoman: Well, I suppose I could get a new phone. Mine has been playing up for a while now, and if it breaks, I’ll have to buy a new one.\nMan: If I were you, I would do just that! You’ll still look gorgeous, plus you’ll be able to take\nbetter pictures at the wedding with your new snazzy phone.\nWoman: You know, I think you’re right.

You can’t pass up something like this.\nWoman: A wise person once said: a bargain ain’t a bargain unless it’s something you need.\nMan: It’s no fun to go shopping with you, you know that?\nWoman: Of course, it is! I’m just rational when it comes to shopping. If I don’t need it, I don’t\nbuy it.\nMan: Where’s the fun in that? I think there is a little bit of magic in buying something new. It’s\ngratifying. That’s why I love shopping. Woman: You’re nuts!\nMan: And you are way too uptight.\nWoman: What are you saying?\nMan: You have got to relax. Loosen up, live a little! It’s no fun to be around Ms. “In control of\neverything”.\nWoman: Well, I’m not like that all the time. I try to be spontaneous, but it’s hard for me. I don’t\nwant people to think I’m shallow.\nMan: Trust me, you’re not. And I know just the thing to make you feel better.\nWoman: What?\nMan: In my experience, a bit of shopping works\nreally well to calm the nerves.\nWoman: You think shopping is going to make me feel better?\nMan: Honey, I know it! I’m sure you’d feel great if you bought something not because you\nneeded it, but just because you loved it.\nConversation 3\nWoman:\nTeen Boy: Woman:\nTeen Boy: Woman:\nTeen Boy: Woman:\nTeen Boy: Woman:\nTeen Boy: Woman: Teen Boy:\nI’m on my way to the mall.

They serve their purpose.\nHoney, I know how you feel about consumerism, but you cannot isolate yourself from society. You are starting to look like a hobo.\nNothing wrong with that. If someone dismisses me because of my looks, I don’t want to have anything to do with them.\nA piece of advice from someone who rebelled against everything most of her life: if you think everyone is stupid, no one will ever listen to you. Give people a chance.\nI don’t want to fight with you, Mom. Let it go.\nFine, but I’m not going anywhere else with you if you look like this. That means I’m not taking you with me to the contemporary art exhibit on Saturday.\nHey! Not fair. I was the one who told you about that.\nSorry. I’m standing by my principles.

Shortly after I was born, my parents moved away from Los Angeles and settled in a small town named Spring Valley in the Midwest. It was one of those towns that seemed to have stopped in time. We lived in a simple, but big house, on a street full of houses that looked just like it. We were made to feel so welcome there that my dad never even considered moving, even after their financial situation became more comfortable.\nWe had a routine that almost resembled a sitcom. I woke up, we had breakfast together, my dad would leave for work, and my brother and I got on the bus to go to school. Mom worked as a writer, so she was lucky enough to work from home. After school, we would ride our bikes around the neighborhood or play ball until it began to get dark. As soon as my Dad got home, we’d have dinner and then spend some quality time doing stuff together. It seems very corny nowadays, but I treasure these memories. The years we spent in that little town helped me shape the values of the person I would become.\nSince it was a very small town, we sort of knew everybody, and everyone took care of each other. I remember Ms. Peterson, from the grocery store, would always send me home if she caught me out riding my bike after 6:00 p.m. My mother became an influential member in the community and was appointed head of the school council, and some years later she was chosen to lead the town council. As for my dad, he worked for some time at an accounting office and then started his own accounting firm.\nI moved out of Spring Valley when I went to college, but I think it’s fair to say that the city never truly left me. I’m in a serious relationship now, and I imagine in some years’ time I’ll be married with children. It won’t surprise me if, when that happens, I decide to move back to my little town. And since my mother will probably be re-elected mayor, chances are I will be very welcome.\nUNIT 1 - FAMILY MATTERS\n","In which paragraph does the author...\n1. mention where he lived before?\n2. talk about his family’s interaction with the community?\n3. explain the title of the article?\n4. describe his routine as a child?\n5. mention his mother’s current occupation?\n6. talk about his plans?\n7. describe his neighborhood?\n8. describe the impact that Spring Valley had in his life?\nUSE OF ENGLISH\nComplete the sentences by either writing the missing word or by choosing the best alternative.\n1.

Here’s a little update on the boys.\nJoshua is 5 years old now. He started kindergarten across the street this year. He loves his teacher, Mrs. Boudreau. His favorite classes are gym, art, and music. He’s made lots of new friends and he’s learning to read. I call him a reading maniac. He also likes learning about animals, the planets, learning how things work and doing experiments.\nConrad, who’s 2 years old now, loves to play with his big brother and repeats everything he says and does. He started preschool on Fridays and he’s learning his ABCs, counting, colors, and songs. He likes to play with Play-Doh, listen to stories, and jump on his trampoline.\nAfter two years at his Wall Street analyst job, Luke decided to make a move which, in retrospect, was a very good thing given what’s happening on Wall Street now. He has always been interested in energy conservation and is now working for NYSERDA (New York State Energy Research and Development Authority), managing investments and projects to improve the ways we use electricity.\nAfter six years as a professional developer for teachers, I resigned to stay at home with the boys for the remaining brief and precious preschool years. And somehow my life is as busy and full as ever. I have become involved in our school district in various ways, from volunteering in Joshua’s classroom to being on a budget advisory group for the district. And I’m still writing English test items and multicultural children’s book reviews.\nWell, that’s all the news from us. Hope you are all doing well.

Research has demonstrated that increased mental fatigue of being in a city can cause people to choose chocolate cake instead of an apple, or fries covered in melted cheese and bacon instead of a healthy salad. This is something particularly cruel about city life: it takes away our ability to resist temptation while it surrounds us with it, from fast-food outlets to fancy clothing stores. The\nEven in the face of these shocking revelations, the question remains: why do cities continue to grow? And why, even in the digital era, do they continue to be the source of intellectual life?\nRecent research by scientists at the Santa Fe Institute has demonstrated that city life is also responsible\nfor critical moments of creation, innovation, and problem solving as strangers interact with one another\nin unpredictable ways. It is the “concentration of social interactions” that is largely responsible for urban creativity, according to the scientists. Throughout our history, cities with\nbig populations have become thriving centers of creativity and cultural activity.\nSo what is the key to remaining healthy in the city? Many people don’t seem\nto find it and move out. Those who succeed in this chaotic environment are the ones who find ways to alleviate the psychological damage of the metropolis while still preserving its benefits.\nTHE CITY HAS always been an engine of intellectual life, from the 18th-century coffeehouses of London, where citizens gathered to discuss chemistry and radical politics, to the Left Bank bars\ncontinually about where they’re going and how to get there, the potential danger of muggers hidden among the crowd just waiting for a moment of distraction, and the list goes on. A city is so overstuffed with stimuli that we need to constantly redirect our attention so that we aren’t distracted by irrelevant things, like a flashing neon sign or\nof modern Paris, where Pablo Picasso spoke extensively about modern art. Without the metropolis, we might not have had the great art of Shakespeare or James Joyce; even Einstein was inspired by commuter trains.\nthe cellphone conversation of a nearby passenger on the bus. The mind is like a powerful supercomputer, but the act of paying attention consumes much of its processing power.\nend result is too many calories and too much credit card debt.\nAnd yet, city life isn’t easy. While\nthe city may be a fertile ground for intellectual production, it is also a deeply unnatural and overwhelming environment. Scientists have examined how the city affects the brain, and the results are alarming. After spending a few minutes on a crowded city street, the brain is less able to hold things in memory, and suffers from reduced self- control. While it’s long been recognized that city life is exhausting, this new research suggests that cities actually make people dumber, sometimes dramatically so.\nConsider everything your brain has\nto keep track of as you walk down a busy street; crowded sidewalks full\nof distracted pedestrians, dangerous crosswalks that require the brain to monitor the flow of traffic, the confusing urban grid, which forces people to think\nNatural settings, in contrast, don’t require the same amount of cognitive effort. They are full of objects that automatically capture our attention, yet without triggering a negative emotional response. The part of your brain that directs attention can relax deeply, recovering itself. Nature is surprisingly beneficial for the brain. Studies have demonstrated, for instance, that hospital patients recover more quickly when they can see trees from their windows. Even glimpses of nature improve brain performance because they provide a mental break from the urban scenario. This also helps explain why, according to several studies, children with attention-deficit disorder have fewer symptoms in natural settings. When surrounded by trees and animals, they are less likely to have behavioral problems and are better able to focus on a particular task.\nBut the intensity of city life doesn’t just make it harder to focus: it also\nUNIT 3 - LIVIN’ IN THE CITY\n","1.

He had to live on the streets at the age of 13, after he lost his mother to a disease that consumed her for years and left his family bankrupt.
