everything; fewer opportunities, less privacy, there aren’t many like-minded people and, as a consequence, people in small towns often feel lonely and isolated. One man’s paradise can be somebody else’s living hell.
Is that why some people end up moving back to where they came from?
This happens because people’s needs change over time. Both the city and the country have several pros and cons. What matters is what is more important or necessary to you.
Can you elaborate on that, Professor?
OK, let’s say two people moved to the city to find better jobs and more leisure activities. They get used to the hectic pace of life and they love the cultural variety and endless possibilities. Time goes by. They reach a more stable financial situation, get married, have kids, and realize they want to slow down and find a quieter, safer place to raise the kids. As a result, they move back to the countryside.
I see your point now. As a matter of fact, I guess that’s why my parents moved back to the country when I was born.
And since you wanted a more exciting life, you moved back to the city, right?
Yes, I suppose so. I left for college and never really looked back, but now I’m wondering if I’ll return one day.
It’s not a rule or anything. Our priorities are constantly changing and we often make adjustments in our lives because of that. I, for instance, raised my kids here in the city and it was fine, but my oldest son has been thinking of moving to the country.
Girl:
I remember the first meal we had together.
It was a complete disaster. I simply did not know what to do, and they didn’t think it was necessary to explain how they ate because
it was so trivial to them. I spent the first ten minutes looking for a fork, a spoon, anything. Then they started just grabbing food from
the plates, so I did the same, and suddenly everyone stopped and looked at me. It was so embarrassing. I mean... How was I supposed to know I was using the wrong hand?
Tell me about it. I had to learn how to eat all over again. My host family was really nice in that way. They knew I wasn’t familiar with their customs and they took the time to teach me.
I was actually amazed at the ritualistic way in which they conducted every step of the meal. It was about a lot more than just eating. The only part that really killed me was using chopsticks.

Professor, nowadays lots of people move out of big metropolitan areas due to the stress of what they call “big city life”. Do you think that’s the best solution?
Not necessarily, small towns have problems of their own. There are considerably less employment opportunities, and not much room to grow. That’s why thousands of people leave small towns and arrive in big cities every day searching for a better life.
So, where is the best quality of life then?
I believe our quality of life is not determined by whether we live in a big city or small town, but rather by whether the place we live in suits us or not. Enjoying where you live is a key factor for your well-being. That explains why some people will find better quality of life in a big city, for instance.
There are certainly more opportunities in a big city, but can we call it quality of life when you are breathing in polluted air, spending hours stuck in traffic, and putting yourself in danger every day?
That’s a good point, but don’t forget that small town problems can have a pretty bad effect on you as well. There’s usually less of
BITS OF CULTURE
Boy: I was at this nice family home in Dublin. The lady of the house was showing me to my
room and she said, “Go up the apples and turn left.” I looked at her and she repetead, “Off you go, laddie, Up the apples”. I didn’t know what to do, so I just looked at her, paralyzed. Then she pointed to the stairs and said real slow, “Go up the apples, then turn left”. That’s when it hit me. The “apples” were the stairs.
