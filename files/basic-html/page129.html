Haven’t you watched this like, a million times?
So?
What’s the point of watching it if you already know what’s going to happen?
I don’t know... it’s like catching up with an old friend. Look. She’s going to say the funniest thing now.
Have you memorized the dialogue?
Just the most memorable parts.
Gosh, Mom.
Hey! Give it a rest. I don’t judge the stuff you watch online all day long.
I just can’t wrap my mind around this. There are so many other shows out there that are just as good. Why on earth would anyone watch the same show over and over again?
Well, as you said, you just don’t get it. So I won’t even try to explain.
It was a boiling hot day and I’d had a few too many beers. So there I was – shirt off – showing off my not exactly athletic body –
playing songs on my guitar. I was about to
give everyone a break when someone asked me to play Mr. Jones, by the Counting Crows, and it was then that things went downhill. It’s a really catchy tune so I started dancing as well. A cousin of mine filmed the whole thing without telling me. Later on, he uploaded the video on YouTube, and that was when things snowballed. Before I knew it, everyone had seen the video. All my family and friends, all the people at work, even my ex-wife and my two kids. The worst part was, it was hilarious! Even I couldn’t stop laughing every time I saw it. Soon after, somebody rang to ask me permission to show the video on TV. I was far too embarrassed and said no. But I often imagine what might have happened if I had said yes.
Story 2

Conversation 3
It all began a couple of months ago. I was playing with my son and our dog in the backyard. At first, we were having a blast, but then our dog decided it would be even funnier to chew on my son’s flip-flops. Boy, he was so angry. He got up and started to tell off the dog just like I do, and the dog pretended to listen to him, but wouldn’t return the flip-flop. Quietly,
I took my phone, stepped back and filmed
the whole thing. We all had a lot of fun with
the video, and later that day I uploaded it on YouTube for some friends to see it and then just sort of forgot about it. Sometime later a friend of mine called. The video had gone viral! It had over a million views. I was even able to make some money with advertisements.

What are you playing?
I’m not playing. I’m watching a video.
But isn’t this that game you like? Royal Clash or something?
No. It’s a video of someone else playing it. Hmm. Sorry. I just don’t get it.
There are lots of video channels like this. It’s about the game. It shows different moves, strategies, and stuff like that.
Geez! This has millions of views. It’s a very popular channel.
I’m confused. Can you explain to me why somebody would prefer to see someone else play their favorite game instead of playing it themselves?
I play it too, sometimes, but I like watching these videos as well.
Hmm, well, maybe I am getting old.

Woman:
I’ve got nothing to wear to my cousin’s wedding.
Nonsense! You’ve got loads of dresses sitting in your wardrobe and more shoes most people will own in a lifetime.
Oh, you just don’t get it, do you? It’s all about the ritual. You go out, try things on, go from shop to shop, until you find that perfect- looking outfit.
Story 1
Man:
It all started when I had the unfortunate idea of picking up my guitar and playing a few tunes at a barbecue we were having with my family.
