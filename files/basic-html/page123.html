In my country families are much bigger than
in many other places. In my house alone we have two aunts, three uncles, my grandparents and, of course, my mother, father, brothers and sisters. We are very happy living together, even if sometimes our values are different from generation to generation.
2
In my country children usually leave home when they go to college. Leaving our parents’ house makes us far more independent and autonomous. Many of us get jobs and never go back to our original homes. I think that’s one of the reasons we have so many highways: we travel a lot...
3
In some places in my country, elder parents normally live with their daughters, even if
they have many sons. This tradition is not
so common in bigger cities as it is in small towns, but even nowadays some girls don’t get married because they will have to take care of their parents in the future.
4
In the country I come from there isn’t so much pressure on young people to go to college immediately after they finish high school. Many leave their parents’ home, get jobs, and only then start higher education. I believe it is much better this way, as it allows us to make more mature career choices.
5
In my country the elderly are seen as wise and children learn from a very early age that their older relatives, even the ones who have already died, must be respected and honored. Oh, and meals are special moments shared by parents and their children. I’m pretty sure this helps our families be far more harmonious than in many other places.

Welcome back. In today’s program, we’re discussing the concept of family. Families are the base of our society, and they come in different shapes and sizes. We have a guest here to tell us all about his unique family. Welcome, Mitchel.
Glad to be here, Debbie.
So, tell us, Mitchel. What’s your family like?
Some people don’t even refer to us as a family, but we absolutely insist on being called that. We are a different family, but a family even so. There’s me, my twin sisters, my aunt May, and our two dogs. Our parents died in a car crash shortly after the twins were born so we came to live with our aunt. I was only 15 then.
As the older brother, what was it like for you to help raise your sisters?
It was so hard, but my aunt was great handling the whole situation. She taught me how to be an adult and trusted me with the girls since she had to work to provide for us. She is our rock; the most caring person in the world. We have a very deep bond of love and mutual respect.
That was some time ago, right? What are things like nowadays?
Well, now I’m able to help her more financially. I’m working part-time now while I finish college. I’m studying to be a nurse. We also live in a bigger house now which is great for the girls. They have lots of space to play and I finally get to have my own room.
Mitchel, I guess lots of people find yours an unusual family, right?
That’s true. Some people don’t even think of us as a family, since there’s no mother or father, but what really matters is the way we feel. And we all feel like we are part of a family.
And tell me, Mitchel. What are your values?
I mean, what is really important to your family?
The one thing we care about the most is being with each other and spending quality time together. For instance, we have dinner together every day. No TV, no tablets, no phones, we just sit around the table and talk about our day.
That’s very nice. What else is important to you?
