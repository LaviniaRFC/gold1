       	<pre><code>1. 2. 3.
My daughter was spending most of her free time just looking at her phone, and
I was really concerned. Everywhere she went: the dinner table, the bathroom, the car... I sat her down and tried to reason with her, and she was really annoyed by that, like I was some cavemen who didn’t understand anything. It was infuriating! And the worst part is that while I was trying to reason with her, she was still looking
at her damn phone and making faces, as if I
wasn’t even there. I got
so outraged that I just grabbed her phone and threw it out the window. It was completely ruined, and then I told her she couldn’t have a new one until she learned some
self-control. What happened next was really scary. The moment after
I smashed her phone she just stood there, shocked, and then she just lost it and started screaming hysterically. One of the neighbors even called
the police. She was still screaming when they arrived. It was really embarrassing. That was over a week ago, and we haven’t said a word to each other since.
I was a cool dad for many years, but I’m afraid those days are over. Last week my son showed me this amazing new camera app that you use to make short videos and take funny pictures. I didn’t
give it much thought at first, but when I saw what he could do with it, I was quite astonished. So I decided to install the app on my phone and asked him to show me how to use it. That’s when I realized
I was outdated. I couldn’t learn how to use the app!
I was trying very hard,
but just couldn’t wrap my mind around it. I was so perplexed that, after a while, my son just gave
up and said “I think it’s better if you just use the regular camera app.” It was shocking.
I got very annoyed at my students whenever they tried to use their phones during class. I mean, it was so irritating. Not
to mention disrespectful. Then the other day we had a meeting and the head teacher explained we were going to implement a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy in the school. It means we’re now supposed to encourage students
to use their phones as a learning tool. At first, I
was really puzzled and didn’t really know what
to do. However, the other teachers were having astonishing results so I decided to give it a try. It was very surprising to see that students were actually becoming more engaged and were participating
a lot more. Last Friday I
was amazed to see all
my students – really, all
of them – had done their homework. The reason was that they had to use their phones to do it.
