Speaker 4
We value honesty above everything else. I am very transparent in everything I do, and I guess the girls learned to be like that from me. The other thing is trust. We trust each other no matter what.
And how old are the girls now?
The girls are seven years old, and they are still a handful. For instance, they are starting to ask those complicated questions.
This is such a great example for so many people out there. Young people can accomplish a lot when we encourage and trust them. Do you think your family is an example to other families?
I don’t know, Debbie. It’s hard to compare us with more traditional families. We just do the best we can with what we’ve got. The important thing is that we have a powerful sense of family and a strong connection.
That’s a great story, Mitchel. Thank you for sharing it with us.
EXPLORING 2
Woman:
I don’t really think it’s fair to pin all this on the boy’s mother. She was in a relationship with him for several years and when they broke up, he never even called to see how she was doing. I guess there’s plenty of blame to go around.
LANGUAGE WORKOUT 1
Number 1
Woman:
Number 2
Teen Boy:
Speaker 1
Man: I believe Ben is telling the truth. I know him, and I’m telling you, he’d never do anything like reject or hide his own son. If you ask me, I think the boy’s mother is in the wrong. It was selfish not to tell him. He would probably have asked her to marry him instead of breaking up with her.
Speaker 2
These are my parents. As you can see, my father is a lot older than my mom. She’s so pretty that sometimes people ask my dad if she’s his daughter. He hates that. These are my sisters. Betty is the oldest of the three and Suzie is my baby-sister. She’s only seventeen. Actually, my uncle took this picture the day before Suzie travelled to Italy on an exchange program. She’s been there for the past 5 months.
Woman:
I suppose things like these do happen. The boy’s mother wanted to bring him up all by herself so she moved away. Anyway, there’s no point in going around blaming people. The important thing is to move on. I hope they can get over all this and have a normal father-son relationship.
Speaker 3
Man: Everyone says Ben didn’t know about the boy, but I doubt it. I find it hard to believe the boy’s mother never tried to get in touch and tell him he was going to be a father. I’m pretty sure she tried to reach him somehow.
Number 3
Teen Boy:
My mother got really angry with me yesterday. We were having a barbecue in the backyard and I was supposed to care for my little brother while she fed my baby sister. We always have to help mom because a baby and a two-year-old together are a little too much for anyone on their own to look after. Anyway, little Timmy was playing with his toys on the grass and I got distracted playing my guitar. Before I knew it, little Timmy tried to climb up the table. He pulled the tablecloth and all the food came down on him. He wasn’t hurt, but lunch was officially ruined.
It took us quite a long time to climb up
the mountain and it was quite dangerous because it got dark and we couldn’t camp for the night. I guess we were pretty lucky because the sky was clear and the moon was out, giving us a little bit of light.
