       	<pre><code>Girl:
It was my second month in a family home in Barcelona, and the couple’s teenage son had been hitting on me since I’d arrived there. I was feeling very uncomfortable, so I went to the parents to have a word with them. I explained the situation and said that I really liked the
boy, but that he was confusing things and
was embarassing me. Next thing I know the father starts screaming and the mother starts crying. I didn’t know back then, but the Spanish word “embarazada” means pregnant! So they understood that their seventeen-year-old son had gotten me pregnant. That was a fine mess I got myself into. It took me over an hour to explain to them what was actually happening.
GRAMMAR TALK
Speaker 7
Man: This was a disappointment to me. I don’t have quite as many options as I was led to believe. The pay is a bit better, but since the cost of living is higher, in the end my financial situation is almost the same.
Speaker 8
Woman:
UNIT 4
I think it’s slightly more complicated now.
In the big city, we seem to have a lot more relationships, but people are not as close as to what I’m used to. Relationships here are far more superficial.

It’s not quite the same here. I was used to big rooms and large backyards. Now I have to live in an apartment that is not much bigger than my dad’s kitchen.
2
This is significantly better. What an improvement! Where I used to live we only had one of everything: one movie theater, one nightclub, one mall. It’s no wonder everyone knew where everyone had been the night before.
3
I think I was lucky in this respect. I live near
a big park, so it’s almost as good as it was back home. It’s not exactly the same as having squirrels living in your back garden, but my daily walks in the park made the transition a lot easier.
4
I honestly don’t know if it’s much better or much worse. There are a lot of ways to get around, but everything is always so crowded. At least now I know can get by without a car.
5
I know this problem is normally a lot worse in the city, but to be honest, in my case I guess it’s pretty much the same. There was a big factory in the town where I lived, so I was no stranger to breathing in smoke.
6
This has been terrible. I’m not nearly as far from work as I used to be, but it takes me twice as long to get there. I knew this was going to be an issue, but it’s way more difficult to cope with than I had expected.
LANGUAGE WORKOUT 1
Conversation 1
Teen Girl:
Teen Boy: Teen Girl:
Teen Boy: Teen Girl:
Are you still planning to move out of town after we graduate?
Sure thing. I can’t wait to get out of this town.
You must be out of your mind. You’re exchanging this quiet, wonderful place for traffic, stress and pollution.
That may be true, but big cities have a lot more opportunities. We both know I won’t find a good job here.
I don’t think I would want any of these “wonderful” opportunities. Will you get a better salary? Sure, yes, but the cost of living is way higher.
Conversation 2
Woman: That’s it. I’ve just finished unpacking the last box. We are officially moved in.
Man: It’s going to be nice living in the city, but if I’m honest I already miss our old house.
Woman: It was a bit nicer, wasn’t it?
Man: A bit? The old house was much better than
this one.
Woman: Oh, come on. It’s not that bad. Plus, we agreed not to spend all our money until we
were sure we wanted to stay here. Man: Yeah, I know...
